## Business Logic

### Context:
The client is a holding company with more than 40 years of presence in the market. They have 4 top companies in Peru in the Retail and Banking sector: “La Curacao” and “Tiendas Efe” are domestic appliance stores. “Motocorp” is a chain of stores specialized in the sale of multi-brand motorcycles, and “Financiera Efectiva” offers credit products.

The client carries out several customer satisfaction surveys.
While there is an initial classification from the survey tool, that only sort the feedback in three groups ("detractor", "pasivo", "promotor"). However, a deeper analysis is needed in order to tag each comment accurately and so far this has been a manual process.

### Objectives:
- The main objective is to automate the manual analysis and classification of these survey comments. In other words, to evaluate and tag customer feedback.
- Store the survey results in an organized manner.
- Display a summary chart by group type and a ranking of commonly used tags from one batch[^1] or multiple batches, by selecting them.
- Filter the results by specified criteria.
- Download the analysis results and the added tags for further analysis.

[^1]: A batch refers to a .xls file that has been uploaded and processed by the system. Each .xls file contains a list of survey comments.
