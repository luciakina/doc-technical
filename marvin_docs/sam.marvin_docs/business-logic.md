## Business Logic

### Background:
The original client carries out several customer satisfaction surveys.
While there is an initial classification from the survey tool, that only sort the feedback in three groups ("detractor", "pasivo", "promotor"). However, a deeper analysis is needed in order to add tags to each comment accurately and so far this has been a manual process.

### Objectives:
- The main objective is to automate the manual analysis and classification of these survey comments. In other words, to evaluate and tag customer feedback.
- Store the survey results in an organized manner.
- Display a summary chart by group type and a ranking of commonly used tags from one or multiple processes, by selecting them.
- Filter the results by specified criteria.
- Compare two or more processes to analyze the evolution of tags, by using bechmark charts. 
- Download the analysis results and the added tags for further analysis.
