# SAM MARVIN APP - Tech Specs #

## Short description
Application that automates the analysis and categorization of texts, by uploading excel documents.

## Terminology

- Proceso - A process refers to the action of analyzing a database (excel or csv document)
- Benchmark - Comparative charts of tags performance on a period of time, it is obtained by comparing two or more "procesos".
- Etiquetas - Tags that the process assigns to each text or comment.

## Context
The original client carries out several customer satisfaction surveys.
While there is an initial classification from the survey tool, that only sort the feedback in three groups ("detractor", "pasivo", "promotor"). However, a deeper analysis is needed in order to add tags to each comment accurately and so far this has been a manual process.

## Goals
- The user must be able to log into the platform using a registered email and password.
- The user must be able to upload data to the platform uploading files in .xls format. 
- There must be a dashboard where the user can see the list of uploaded and processed files, called batches. And be able to search and select one or more of them.
- After the batches are selected, the user must see the statistics charts. One chart would show the total of comments for each group type ("detractor", "pasivo", "promotor"). The other chart would show the most used tags.
- The user must be able to filter the results by a given set of criteria and generate new statistic charts accordingly. 
- The user can compare two or more processes as a benchemark option.
- The user must be able to download the new file generated that includes the tags, name of the batch and upload date-time.
